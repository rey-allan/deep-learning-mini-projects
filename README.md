# deep-learning-mini-projects
:brain: Deep Learning Mini Projects using PyTorch.

These are mini applications of various Deep Learning algorithms in PyTorch. Most of the projects are re-implementations of some of my favorite assignments from Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization. All projects are standalone Jupyter Notebooks that can be executed independently.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Projects

- Feed Forward
  - Cat vs Non-cat Classification
- Convolutional
  - Hand Sign Recognition Using CNN
  - Hand Sign Recognition Using ResNet
  - Art Generation Using Neural Style Transfer
- Sequence
  - Dinosaur Name Generation Using RNN
  - Jazz Improvisation Using LSTM
  - Emojifier Using LSTM and Word Embeddings
  - Date Translation Using Neural Machine Translation
- Generative
  - Wardrobe Generation Using DCGAN
  - Wardrobe Generation Using VAE

## Issues

If any of the high-level descriptions or comments about the algorithms and techniques inside the notebooks is wrong, or if you encounter any problems running the projects; let me know!
